Scripts to fit occupancy models for the safeguard project.

Occupancy models were fitted using the Sparta package (https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/sparta)

Script 1 is filtering the species with enough data to be analysed and put the data in the right format to fit the model.

Script 2 is fitting the model for each species, independently, on a HPC.
